# Starbound Inventory Updgrader

### For [bk3k's 120-slot inventory mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=882900100)

As bk3k explained on the mod page, vanilla characters can't be loaded while using their extended inventory mod. It'll crash your game. Unfortunately, some people (like me) may have only found this mod after already establishing a game far enough that you don't want to lose everything and restart. While it is technically possible to [manually update your character files](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/882900100/133259956011112917/#c2132869574268909855), that's difficult, tedious, annoying, and not something everyone's comfortable doing.

Enter the Starbound Inventory Upgrader!

All you have to do is download the [latest release](https://github.com/PrincessRTFM/StarboundInventoryUpdater/releases/latest), unzip it somewhere, and run `StarboundInventoryUpdater.exe` to automatically upgrade _all_ of your character files to a 120-slot inventory ready to go. That's it. It's that simple.

## :warning: **THIS WILL AFFECT ALL OF YOUR CHARACTER FILES** :warning:

If you want to keep any of them vanilla, back them up first!
